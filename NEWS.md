# phylepic 0.3.0

* Update citation to published manuscript.
* Overhaul the way that binning works. Instead of special stats that handled
  weekly binning, these now take their bin definitions from the scale breaks.
  This means that whereas before you could only do weekly binning or no binning,
  now you can use arbitrary bins by configuring the scale breaks.
